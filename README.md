### Introduction to coarse graining: 2025 CCPBioSim Training Week
Authors: <i>Robert Clark, Iain Peter Shand Smith</i>

Here we present a practical introduction to the construction and simulation of coarse-grained (CG) membrane protein systems. We have also included a comparison to an equivalent all-atom (AA) simulation in order to raise awareness of where each has merit.

We have separated the content into 5 conceptually distinct parts:

1) Construction of an AA membrane protein system
2) Simulation/Visualisation of the AA system
3) Construction of a CG membrane protein system  
4) Equilibration of the CG system
5) Analysis of protein function and membrane dynamics

The user should work sequentially through each numbered directory within this repo\
starting from `1-assembly` and finishing with `5-analysis`


We acknowledge the work published by the Vanni lab which inspired the topic of this practical:
