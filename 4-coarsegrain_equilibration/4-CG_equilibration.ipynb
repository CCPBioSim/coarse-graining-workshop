    "When generating the structure of a model, it is often the case that the generated configuration of atoms would not readily exist in equilibrium physiological conditions. Individual protein structures may be determined using X-ray crystallography Shi (2014) or cryo-EM Lyumkis (2019) techniques and thus the obtained structure data is that of the crystalline or frozen protein, or if generating structures using Alphafold, protein structure is simply a prediction learned from large databases of these crystal or cryo structures. \n",
    "\n",
    "If algorithmic procedures such as CHARMM-GUI, COBY, Martinize or some other scripted tool are used to generate the initial model this may lead to unnaturally ordered structures that bear little resemblance to their in vivo forms. For example; lipids may be packed incorrectly, amino acid fragments may occupy the incorrect rotameric state or proteins may need to reorient within a membrane. It is therefore necessary to perform a set of equilibration steps to bring the system to a more physiologically accurate equilibrium state before meaningful information may be extracted regarding its dynamics. This so-called equilibration phase of MD simulation is split into three distinct stages; energy minimisation, NVT and NPT.\n",
